        Our family business has been involved in fruit cultivation for several years. In orchards spanning several hectares, we grow blueberries, strawberries, and aronia with respect for the environment and a focus on preserving biodiversity. Organic quality is not just a slogan but a part of our daily work.

    In our orchards, you will find both early and late varieties, making blueberries available from July to September. Each variety, whether itâ€™s Bluecrop, Liberty, Spartan, or Chandler, is exceptional in its own way.
